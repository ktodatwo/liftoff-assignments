# Project Outline

### Overview
Our project will be a bill tracker that allows users to track their bills, overview their expenses visually with a graphic, and organize all outgoing costs in one central location. Users will be able to log in to their account, create, edit and remove bills. They will be able to set a reminder for when an upcoming bill is due. 

Our group chose this project because we all felt a connection with its core features-it'll be a central place to keep track of all bills.  No longer will a bill be missed because it was at the bottom of a stack of paper or lost somewhere in the junk mail inbox.  If you remember to put the bill into the bill tracker, you remember to pay it.

### Features
- User Sign up: Users will be able to create an account for themselves, giving them the ability to input their bills and set due dates.
- User Login: Users will be able to log in after creating a profile
- Edit, Create, Delete Bills: Users will be able to create, edit, and delete bills
- Bill Categories Represented Visually: Users will be able to view a graphic of their bill categories
- Set Bill Reminders: Users will be able to set a reminder of when a bill is due, and the bill tracker will send a reminder email 

### Technologies
Java
ThymeLeaf
SQL
Bootstrap
Google Charts
Gmail API

### What I'll Have to Learn
Overall the group is more familiar with Java, ThymeLeaf, SQL, and BootStrap since we built a similar project using those tools in the independent track of LC101.  
We're not as familiar with Google charts and Gmail API and recognize that we will have to take a deep dive into those subjects to create our project.
